All of the big brands are about where you'd expect, with the \"High Horology\" trio dominating.

Values for Patek Philippe on the used market actually do BETTER than their new counterparts. Just goes to show how well their new marketing strategy has been working out for them by artificially creating demand they just keep generating more buzz. AP also seems to retain their value, but the rest do show depreciation.\n\n# ðŸ”„ New vs Used Prices\n\nNow lets compare the differences between new and used prices to see a quantitative number for those gaps.\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\n# Calculate average prices and the difference\nprice_comparison <- watch_data %>%\n  filter(!is.na(`Price (New)`), !is.na(`Price (Used)`)) %>%\n  group_by(Brand) %>%\n  head(40) %>%\n  summarise(\n    avg_price_new = mean(`Price (New)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_price_used = mean(`Price (Used)`, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(price_difference = avg_price_new - avg_price_used) %>%\n  arrange(desc(price_difference))\n\n# Plot the price difference\nggplot(price_comparison, aes(x = reorder(Brand, price_difference), y = price_difference)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Difference Between Average New and Used Prices by Brand\", x = \"Brand\", y = \"Price Difference ($)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n```\n\nNow looking at these numbers we get a better picture on these used value fall offs. As predicted, Patek is far and away hitting over it's new value, and if you have \\$50k to drop, definitely get one new. Vacheron Constantin suprisingly has the worst fall off, so if you wanted something from the Holy Horology and don't own several Yachts, they might be your best bet.\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nwatch_data %>%\n  gather(key = \"Condition\", value = \"Price\", `Price (New)`, `Price (Used)`) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Price, fill = Condition)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    bins = 4, \n    alpha = 0.7, \n    position = \"identity\",\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Condition) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of New and Used Prices\", x = \"Price ($)\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = \"$\"))\n```\n\nLooking at the listings pulled from the dataset, more watches are being sold used on the lower end of the price spectrum, but a higher number of new models being sold on the higher end.
