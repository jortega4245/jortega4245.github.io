It seems watch brand prices just keep going up, while movements and case materials remain stagnant, and when materials do change, these brands charge an arm and a leg (looking at you Rolex.)\n\n![Rolex Titanium Yacht-Master 42](images/Rolex%20Titanium%20Yachtmaster%2042.webp){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"738\"}\n\nBut it isn't all doom and gloom, a lot of micro brands and entry level friendly brands still offering great bang for your buck. So without further ado, lets look at our entire dataset and look at some common trends on prices these days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](average-prices_files/figure-html/price-by-brand-new-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrices just seem to be going up, and watches are no exception. All of the big brands are about where you'd expect, with the \"High Horology\" trio dominating. Blancpain and Zenith are also unexpectedly high, followed by main staples such as Rolex and other top luxury brands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](average-prices_files/figure-html/price-by-brand-used-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at used prices is another story, however. Values for Patek Philippe on the used market actually do BETTER than their new counterparts. Just goes to show how well their new marketing strategy has been working out for them by artificially creating demand they just keep generating more buzz. AP also seems to retain their value, but the rest do show depreciation.\n\n# New vs Used Prices\n\nNow lets compare the differences between new and used prices to see a quantitative number for those gaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](average-prices_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow looking at these numbers we get a better picture on these used value fall offs. As predicted, Patek is far and away hitting over it's new value, and if you have \\$50k to drop, definitely get one new. Vacheron Constantin suprisingly has the worst fall off, so if you wanted something from the Holy Horology and don't own several Yachts, they might be your best bet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwatch_data %>%\n  gather(key = \"Condition\", value = \"Price\", `Price (New)`, `Price (Used)`) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Price, fill = Condition)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    bins = 4, \n    alpha = 0.7, \n    position = \"identity\",\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Condition) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of New and Used Prices\", x = \"Price ($)\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = \"$\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](average-prices_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the listings pulled from the dataset, more watches are being sold used on the lower end of the price spectrum, but a higher number of new models being sold on the higher end. This could mean more people are holding on to their high end models, or they just don't sell very well.\n",
